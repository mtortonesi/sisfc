SISFC (Simulator for IT Service in Federated Clouds) is a simulator designed to
reenact the behaviour of IT services in federated Cloud environments.


## Installation

As SISFC was developed in Ruby, you will first need a working Ruby interpreter.
Once you have Ruby installed, you can install SISFC through RubyGems:

    gem install sisfc

While SISFC should work on MRI and Rubinius without problems, we highly
recommend you to run it on top of JRuby. Since JRuby is our reference
development platform, you will be very likely to have a smoother installation
and usage experience when deploying SISFC on top of JRuby.


## Usage

To run the simulator, simply digit:

    sisfc simulator.conf vm_allocation.conf

where simulator.conf and vm\_allocation.conf are your simulation environment
and vm allocation configuration files respectively.

The examples directory contains a set of example configuration files, including
an [R](http://www.r-project.org) script that models a stochastic request
generation process. To use that script, you will need R with the VGAM and
truncnorm packages installed.

Note that the SISFC was not designed to be run directly by users, but instead
to be integrated within higher level frameworks that implement continuous
optimization (such as [BDMaaS+](https://github.com/DSG-UniFE/bdmaas-plus-core)).
